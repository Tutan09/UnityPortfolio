# TutanDev Unity Portfolio

This repository contains different projects that are not big enough for its own repository.

The different projects are not related to each other, each project is a practical use case of something I have learnt lately.

## Repository Structure

Each project is contained within its own folder inside the Assets folder.

## Current projects:
  - **Transparency Chroma:** Simple chroma shader with a custom Inspector. [Go to project](https://github.com/TutanDev/UnityPortfolio/tree/master/UnityProject/Assets/TransparentChromaShader)
- **Parametric Surfaces:** Contemplative Scene showing animated 3D Surfaces calculated with a Compute Shader. [Go to project](https://github.com/TutanDev/UnityPortfolio/tree/master/UnityProject/Assets/ParametricSurfaces)
